          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The previously implemented Perry Mansion Cultural Center (PMCC) website
            was created to attract donors and draw visitors. However, the design of the
            site was not inviting or professional so the needs were not met.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="objective">
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Build a WordPress site for PMCC that provides a professional feel so
            donors are comfortable making donations directly from the website
            while maintaining a visually interesting interface that will draw new
            visitors to the site.

          <h2>First</h2>
          <p>
            Perry Mansion Cultural Center had a website prior to coming to the Community-Based
            Tech Projects class for a redesign. The team had to review the current site and
            determine its challenges so the newly designed site wouldn’t repeat any mistakes
            from the old site.

        <div class="PMCCstep2">
          <h2>Second</h2>
          <p>
            After reviewing PMCC’s previous website, our team collaboratively began documentation
            of the project. This included determining the target users, user stories based on the
            target users, the scope of the project, functional, non-functional, and technical
            requirements, along with the assumptions we were making and identified constraints
            we would face.

        <div class="PMCCstep3">
          <h2>Third</h2>
          <p>
            Development began with assigning each team member with pages that would need to be
            included in the PMCC site.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I was responsible for developing the Events page which included two subpages,
            an event calendar page and a page where users could book events.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To do this, I had to decide the plugins that best fit the needs of these pages
            and implement them in an apealing and easy-to-use way.

          <h2>Time Restriction</h2>
          <p>
            This project was completed over the course of one 10-week academic term. Much of the first 5 weeks
            was spent focusing on documentation, leaving the entire development process for the second half of
            the term.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This was a good experience because it required us to work in 1-week sprint cycles and check in with each
            other and the client as often as possible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="PMCCchallenge2">
          <h2>Communication with Client</h2>
          <p>
            Our client had health challenges during the course of the PMCC website redesign, which made
            communication difficult at times.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We had to quickly adapt and work with what was available from the previous
            site along with what we thought was best for the client to ensure we could present a finished product
            at the end of the course.
