          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The previously implemented Perry Mansion Cultural Center (PMCC) website
            was created to attract donors and draw visitors. However, the design of the
            site was not inviting or professional so the needs were not met.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="objective">
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Build a WordPress site for PMCC that provides a professional feel so
            donors are comfortable making donations directly from the website
            while maintaining a visually interesting interface that will draw new
            visitors to the site.

          <h2>Review Existing Site</h2>
          <p>
            Perry Mansion Cultural Center had a website prior to coming to the Community-Based
            Tech Projects class for a redesign. The team had to review the current site and
            determine its challenges so the newly designed site wouldn’t repeat any mistakes
            from the old site.

          <h2>Define Users and Project Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            After reviewing PMCC’s previous website, our team collaboratively began documentation
            of the project. This included identifying the target users and documenting user stories
            for them, the project scope; functional, non-functional, and technical
            requirements; and any assumptions we made and constraints we would face.

          <h2>WordPress Development</h2>
          <p>
            Development began with assigning each team member with pages that needed to be
            included in the PMCC site.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I was responsible for developing the Events page which included two subpages,
            an event calendar page, and a page where users could book events.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To do this, I researched and chose plugins that best fit the needs of these pages.
            The plugins were implemented in an appealing and easy-to-use way so the client would be able to
            maintain them after we passed off the completed site.

          <h2>Time Restriction</h2>
          <p>
            This project was completed over the course of one 10-week academic term. Much of the first 5 weeks
            was spent focusing on documentation, leaving the entire development process for the second half of
            the term.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This was a good experience because it required us to work in 1-week sprint cycles and check in with each
            other and the client as often as possible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="PMCCchallenge2">
          <h2>Communication with Client</h2>
          <p>
            Our client had personal obligations throughout the course of the PMCC website redesign, which made
            communication difficult at times.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We had to quickly adapt and work with what was available from the previous
            site along with what we thought was best for the client to ensure we could present a finished product
            at the end of the course.
