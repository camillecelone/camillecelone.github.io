          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            There are no existing web applications that were created specifically
            to allow users to track which restaurants and bars they wish to attend.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="objective">
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Using Vue.js, design a web app that allows users to track the restaurants
            and bars they would like to attend, as well as those they have already attended.

              <h2>First</h2>
              <p>
                Team members determined there was a need for this site because both
                team members have had difficulty choosing where to eat.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="SEstep2">
              <h2>Second</h2>
              <p>
                We developed the concept for the application, deciding there would need
                to be an input form and some type of table to display information.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="SEstep3">
              <h2>Third</h2>
              <p>
                We created a data model for the site to help determine necessary functionality
                of the site.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="SEstep4">
              <h2>Fourth</h2>
              <p>
                Wireframe sketches allowed us to do an in-depth break down of SocialEater
                and determine the components that would be needed.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="SEstep5">
              <h2>Fifth</h2>
              <p>
                Developing a very basic HTML site without utilizing Vue.js allowed us to
                further conceptualize the site before development.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="SEstep6">
              <h2>Sixth</h2>
              <p>
                We developed the site using Vue.js. The code for this project can be
                viewed on my GitHub.
              </p>

          <div class="SEgoal1">
            <h2>Mobile Platform</h2>
            <p>
              This application is one that would likely be used while on the go. A mobile application would be
              the best solution to the problem.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the future, a mobile application would be designed to have individual pages for each
              list, and a page for the input form so users can edit and view their lists while they're
              out and about.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="SEgoal2">
            <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
            <p>
              The current version of SocialEater doesn't fully function because there is no back-end in which
              data can be stored.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Ideally, a future version of thise application would allow users to create accounts in which
              they could save their lists and share them with friends within the app or with a url
              for those who do not have an account.
