        <div class="problem">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            It is difficult for users to navigate through Arrived when searching
            for information. Immigrants from all over the world will use Arrived,
            so the design must be simple and easy to understand.

        <div class="objective">
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Create wireframes of the Arrived Android application that apply design principles
            to an interface that users are able to easily navigate in order to quickly
            locate desired information.

                  Critique the existing app to determine where changes need to be made
                  based on design principles that are or are not present. I concluded that the
                  following design principles needed my attention: alignment, consistency,
                  proximity, and wayfinding.

                <p>
                  Determine the target users of the Arrived Android app. The identified users
                  were immigrants to the US who need to know their rights, learn about public
                  services they can benefit from, and find help from legal clinics and
                  non-govermental organizations.

                  Create a site map that displays pages present in the original version of
                  the Arrived app and the pages I would be adding to the design in my wireframes.
                  The pages that were present in the original Arrived application are blue
                  and the pages I added in my designs are gray.

                  Sketch. Many iterations of sketches provided me with numerous options
                  when creating a final digital design. I made many different design decisions
                  in each sketch which allowed me to select elements from different sketches to
                  ensure that the final design was the most accessible to users based on
                  universal design principles.

                  Combine sketches to create medium fidelity digital wireframes using
                  Axure that applied the design principles that I identified when
                  critiquing the existing app to create a simple-to-use interface
                  for the target users.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  After creating wireframes, I annotated the designs to note changes based
                  on design principles so the Arrived team could see why specific layout
                  changes were made.

                <h2>Multi-Tasking</h2>
                <p>
                  Mid-way through the redesign of the Arrived Android interface, I was asked to work on a different
                  project for Arrived that would be submitted to the NYC BigApps competition in hopes of funding
                  the development of various Arrived applications.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  I had to switch focus to the other project instead of continuing with this redesign so I was
                  unable to complete a high fidelity prototype of the application. Ultimately, Arrived was not
                  accepted to NYC BigApps and all projects stopped temporarily due to lack of funding.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="ARRIVEDchallenge2">
                <h2>Communication with Team</h2>
                <p>
                  The Arrived team was located all over the country so communication was difficult at times, especially
                  when trying to collaborate with other designers. Projects would often get held up while waiting on
                  other team members to look at progress and upload other portions.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  This was valuable learning experience for me because I got to experience working with others who
                  were not located nearby. This was the first project I worked on where I was required to use Axure
                  for the purpose of shared documents, which I have used on many projects since then.
