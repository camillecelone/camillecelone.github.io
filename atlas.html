            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              There are currently no data visualization tools that allow users to view maps and graphs in the same
              interface. This makes data discovery challenging as users mush switch back and forth between maps
              and graphs to view all necessary data.

          <div class="dualVizObjective">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
              Design an interface that allows users to view maps and graphs of the same data set to aid in data
              discovery.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
              After many iterations, an interface was designed that allowed users to select specific data within
              the map and view that data in a line graph that is shown on the same screen as the map. Users
              can add more data points to an existing graph and view statistical values for each data point.

              Challenges

          <div class="ATLASchallenge1">
            <h2>Multidisciplinary Users</h2>
            <p>
              Atlas was created at The Center for Robust Decisionmaking on Climate and Energy Policy (RDCEP)
              which employs high schools, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students as well as
              professionals. People are from various fields of study such as economics, physical and computer
              sciences, energy technologies, law, and mathematics.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Working with and for people with such varying educational and technical backgrounds often proved
              challenging. People for different fields all want Atlas to display different information so it best
              suits their needs. Determining how to design an interface that works across disciplines was, and
              continues to be, a question the Atlas team is trying to answer.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="ATLASchallenge2">
            <h2>Management Changes</h2>
            <p>
              Over the course of Atlasâ€™ lifetime, there have been two major management changes. These changes
              have led Atlas is different directions which has caused challenges with completing tasks fully.
              Because Atlas will be used by people from various fields, management changes have brought new
              ideas based on the backgrounds of each manager.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Certain features have been placed on hold while others have been prioritized based on the
              functionality new managers feel will be the most beneficial. Then, when management changes,
              prioritized features also change. This has made it difficult to design and develop any
              feature to completion.
